## RWD

**What is Responsive Web Design?**

 
Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones):

Here is an example from W3School try it by yourself [go-there](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_responsive_page)


**Setting The Viewport**

*To create a responsive website, add the following `<meta>` tag to all your web pages*

*This will set the viewport of your page, which will give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.*

**Responsive Images**

*Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size.*

>*Using the width Property*

*If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down*

**Using the max-width Property**

*If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size*

**Media Queries**

*In addition to resize text and images, it is also common to use media queries in responsive web pages.*

*With media queries you can define completely different styles for different browser sizes.*

## Floats

*The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow (in contrast to absolute positioning).*

*The float property is specified as a single keyword, chosen from the list of values below.*

**Values**

- left
>The element must float on the left side of its containing block.

- right
>The element must float on the right side of its containing block.

- none
>The element must not float.

- inline-start
>The element must float on the start side of its containing block. That is the left side with ltr scripts, and the right side with rtl scripts.

- inline-end
>The element must float on the end side of its containing block. That is the right side with ltr scripts, and the left side with rtl scripts.

## SMACCS

**What is SMACCS :**

*(Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS ) is a css methodology that designed by Jonathan Snook in 2011.*

*According to style guide of `SMACSS`, the Css Architecture should not build on 1 stylesheet. *

*It ought to has builded on 5 different categories. The goal of this process is creating flexible, consistent, reusable codes blocks, it prevents iteration of codes.*

>The categories are `base`, `layout`, `module`, `state` and `theme` .

## Grids
